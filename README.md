### Cache Issues

If you're experiencing cache issues where changes aren't appearing in the browser:

1. **Clear Vite cache and restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run clean-dev
   ```

2. **For more persistent issues, clear all caches:**
   ```bash
   npm run clean-all
   ```

3. **In your browser:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click on the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Additional Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after clearing the cache:

1. Check your browser's developer tools for errors
2. Ensure you're not running multiple instances of the dev server
3. Try disabling browser extensions that might interfere with development
